# Project Documentation
## Creating comprehensive documentation for a Django project is a crucial step in ensuring that both developers and users can understand how to use and maintain the application. Below, I'll outline a structure for documenting the Django project with a focus on the CRUD operations for the "Person" model using Django REST framework.

  - Virtual environment setup.
  - Database configuration.
- How to clone the project repository.

##  Project Structure

- Describe the directory structure of the project.
- Explain the purpose of key directories and files.

##  Configuration

- Configuration settings in the `settings.py` file.
- Environment variables and their usage.

## API Documentation

##  API Overview

- Explain the purpose of the API.
